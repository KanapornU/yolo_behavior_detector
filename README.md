# yolo_behavior_detector
The objective of this group project is to develop and evaluate a computer vision system capable of both object detection and behavior interpretation in video streams. Beyond bounding-box annotation, the system is designed to recognize and classify dynamic actions such as running, sliding, rolling, falling, and throwing.
